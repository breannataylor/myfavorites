      <p>Wikipedia says:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Final Fantasy XIV is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game
        (MMORPG) developed and published by Square Enix. Final Fantasy XIV is
        set in the fantasy region of Eorzea, five years after the devastating
        Seventh Umbral Calamity which ended the original version. In the
        Calamity, the elder primal Bahamut escaped from his prison, an ancient
        space station called Dalamud, unleashing an apocalypse across Eorzea.
        Through temporal magic, the player character of the original version
        escaped, reappearing at the start of A Realm Reborn. As Eorzea cements
        its recovery, the player must fend off a reignited invasion from the
        Garlean Empire.

      <h2>Why This is My Favorite</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The storyline is written in a way that the lessons learned by the
          character can be applied to real life.
        </li>
        <li>
          The world is rich in lore that makes the world easier to immerse
          yourself in and really care about the characters you meet and the
          lands you walk through.
        </li>
        <li>
          The team behind the game obviously really cares about both the game
          and the playerbase that plays it.
